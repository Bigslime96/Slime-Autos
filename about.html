     <h3>Attractive purchasing conditions for partner dealers</h3>
     <p>Diversification and risk management are essential factors in the professional trading of used cars. Operating on a local level and the lack of a broad assortment of used cars belong to the most common challenges of the used car industry.

     For the digital B2B acquisition, a cross-brand inventory of over 30,000 vehicles is available to all retailers at market-based purchasing conditions, which is supplemented daily by over 3,000 new additions.
     Registered dealers across Europe have the opportunity to purchase tested and fully documented used cars directly online from SLIMEAUTOS.com with just a few clicks or via the App - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
